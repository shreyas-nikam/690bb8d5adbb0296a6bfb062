In this lab, you will explore the fascinating and critical world of AI security vulnerabilities within agentic AI systems. We'll simulate various attack scenarios, such as prompt injection and data poisoning, on an industrial safety monitoring system. By interacting with the simulation, you'll gain hands-on experience in understanding how these vulnerabilities manifest, their impact on system performance and security metrics, and how to interpret the results.

This simulation provides a controlled environment to study concepts like 'synthetic-identity risk' and 'untraceable data leakage'. You'll see how different attack intensities and types can affect alert frequencies, detection latencies, and agent integrity scores. The goal is to equip you with practical insights into adversarial testing techniques and the importance of robust risk controls in AI system design.

Through interactive visualizations and data analysis, you will learn to:
- Identify common AI-security vulnerabilities.
- Understand the potential impact of different attack vectors.
- Analyze changes in system behavior under attack.
- Grasp the practical implications for designing more secure and adaptive AI systems.

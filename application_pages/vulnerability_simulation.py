    ## Section 7: Vulnerability Simulation - Attack Logic Implementation
    
    This section details the core logic for simulating AI security vulnerabilities. The `simulate_vulnerability_impact` function applies the mathematical models defined earlier to modify the baseline security metrics based on the user-selected `Attack Type`, `Attack Intensity`, and `Number of Compromised Agents`. This simulation will demonstrate the effects of 'synthetic-identity risk' (compromised agents acting maliciously) and 'untraceable data leakage' (covert data exfiltration via altered behavior).

    The simulation of the chosen AI security vulnerability has been applied to the baseline security metrics. We now have a modified dataset that reflects the impact of the attack on alert frequency, agent integrity, and provides details on simulated detection latency. This data will be used for visualization and further analysis.
